# Pose matching and PCA analysis
*last update 05-03-2018*

## Plotting results
### [extract_body_parts_plot.py](src/extract_body_parts_plot.py)
Script to plot images in a folder, overlayed with lines indicating the body
parts found.

## Comparing poses
### [normalize_parts.py](src/normalize_parts.py)
Contains a function for normalizing a found pose: center and scale the
coordinates so that two poses can be compared more easily.
### [extract_body_parts_store.py](src/extract_body_parts_store.py)
Script to analyze all images in a folder (inc subfolders) and store the
found poses in a json file.
### [compare_pose.py](src/compare_pose.py)
Contains a function to compare a pose with a large number of preanalyzed poses.
### [test_compare_pose.py](src/test_compare_pose.py)
Script to test the compare_pose function
### results
![Comparing two poses result](/results/pose_match.jpg)
I encountered the following questions/problems/challenges:
* What to do with missing parts (now the image is discarded)
* How to match the pose comparison to our intuition (what we consider similarity in pose)

## PCA analysis
### [coco_to_openpose.py](src/coco_to_openpose.py)
Contains a function to convert pose annotations as found in the COCO dataset to
a format like returned by the tf-pose-estimation algorithm.
### [read_annotations.py](src/read_annotations.py)
Script to read and convert all the annotations in an annotated person-keypoints
dataset from the COCO datasets.
(I have not included the datasets in this repository, because they are quite
large. You can download the COCO annotations from http://cocodataset.org/#download. The result of this script is included, so you can also skip it.)
### [eigenpose.py](src/eigenpose.py)
Script to perform PCA on processed pose data and plot the found component
vectors.
### results
Using 8475 full poses from the COCO 2017 person-keypoints training set:
![PCA analysis result](/results/eigenposes.jpg)
These images show the principal components of the dataset: the different ways in which the poses vary, ordered by magnitude. So the main variation was found in the (comp 0 + / comp 0 -) offsets, which corresponds roughly to sitting/standing. The next most notable variation corresponds to rotation. In fact, component 1, 4 and 7 roughly correspond to rotation around different axes. (Roll, yaw and pitch).
To play around with the effect of PCA components of *faces* see [this cool online model](https://www.auduno.com/clmtrackr/examples/modelviewer_pca.html) by Audun M. Ã˜ygard.
